# Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by this Code of Conduct. We expect all participants to help create a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and empathetic
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing consideration for different viewpoints and experiences
- Using inclusive language

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, insults, or derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment; doxxing or publishing othersâ€™ private information
- Sexualized language or imagery; unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, deliberate intimidation, or sustained disruption
- Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards. Maintainers may remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code, and will communicate reasons for moderation when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code applies within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community (including using an official email address, posting via official accounts, or acting as an appointed representative).

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the maintainers at **me@apocalix.dev**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

The project team is obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

When addressing violations, maintainers will use these guidelines:

1. **Correction**  
   _Impact_: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.  
   _Consequence_: A private, written warning and clarification of expectations.

2. **Warning**  
   _Impact_: A single incident or series of actions after a correction.  
   _Consequence_: A warning with consequences for continued behavior, which may include temporary limitations.

3. **Temporary Ban**  
   _Impact_: Continued inappropriate behavior after warnings; serious violation of community standards.  
   _Consequence_: Temporary ban from interaction or contribution for a specified period.

4. **Permanent Ban**  
   _Impact_: Demonstrating a pattern of violations; harassment; or aggression.  
   _Consequence_: Permanent removal from community spaces and contribution channels.
