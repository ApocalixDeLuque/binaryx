# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** create a public Issue for security problems. Instead, email us at **me@apocalix.dev** or use **GitHub Security Advisories** to submit a private report.

Include:

- Affected versions/commit SHA
- Environment (OS, runtime, versions)
- Reproduction steps, PoC, and impact
- Any possible mitigations

We will acknowledge receipt within **72 hours**, provide an initial assessment within **7 days**, and aim to release a fix or mitigation within **14–30 days** depending on severity and scope.

## Scope

Security issues that affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of users or data in this project (code, build chain, release artifacts, and deployed configurations for official demos).

Out of scope examples: social engineering against maintainers, vulnerabilities exclusively in third-party dependencies unless our default configuration makes them exploitable.

## Disclosure Policy

- We prefer **coordinated disclosure**. Please give us reasonable time to investigate and remediate before public disclosure.
- After a fix is released, we’ll credit reporters in the release notes unless you request otherwise.

## Supported Versions

We support the latest release. If we maintain LTS branches, they will be listed here with end-of-support dates.

| Version | Supported |
| ------: | :-------- |
|  latest | ✅        |

## CVEs

At our discretion we may request a CVE (or GHSA ID) for high-impact issues once a fix is available.
